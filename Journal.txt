minimumOfFunction program: The program finds the minimum of a function of the userâ€™s choice by initially generating the random value of variable x. Then generates a new value, and compares the output of the function (f(x)) to the previous output, while incrementing x. If the previous value is larger, then decrement x, if not, continue on incrementing. Use the while statement to allow the loop to continue until it reaches the minimum of the function.
