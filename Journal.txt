Two programs using while statement:
1. Digit: The program extracts the digit of a number, while the user enters a natural number.
2. Dice: The program counts the number of times of getting a 6 on a dice out of 1000 rolls,while it randomly rolls the dice (generates random number ranging from 1~6)
It also calculates the probability of getting a 6 in a dice roll.

Draw flow diagram for both programs.
