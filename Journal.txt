primeNumber: A program that asks for the users input n, and prints out the first nth prime number. 
Use for loops and while loops to limit the range of the prime numbers, also to eliminate the non-prime numbers by finding the numbers that have modules of i (i is an integer within the range of 2 to num) that equals to 0. However, the module of 2 of the number 2 equals to 0, thus the program is not able to print 2 (a prime number), so I directly printed 2 using the print statement at the beginning of the while loop.
